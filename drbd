DRBD
Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) mirrors block devices between multiple hosts. The replication is transparent to other applications on the host systems. 

The partition size is not particularly relevant, but both partitions need to be the same size. 

sudo apt-get install drbd8-utils

To configure drbd, on the first host edit /etc/drbd.conf:
global { usage-count no; }
common { syncer { rate 100M; } }
resource r0 {
        protocol C;
        startup {
                wfc-timeout  15;
                degr-wfc-timeout 60;
        }
        net {
                cram-hmac-alg sha1;
                shared-secret "secret";
        }
        on drbd01 {
                device /dev/drbd0;
                disk /dev/sdb1;
                address 192.168.0.1:7788;
                meta-disk internal;
        }
        on drbd02 {
                device /dev/drbd0;
                disk /dev/sdb1;
                address 192.168.0.2:7788;
                meta-disk internal;
        }
} 

Now copy /etc/drbd.conf to the second host: 
scp /etc/drbd.conf drbd02:~

And, on drbd02 move the file to /etc: 
sudo mv drbd.conf /etc/

drbdadm utility initialize the meta data storage. On each server execute: 
sudo drbdadm create-md r0

on both hosts, start the drbd daemon: 
sudo /etc/init.d/drbd start

On the primary host, enter the following: 
sudo drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary all
*data will start syncing with the secondary host 

To watch the progress, on drbd02
watch -n1 cat /proc/drbd

add a filesystem to /dev/drbd0 and mount it: 
sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/drbd0
sudo mount /dev/drbd0 /srv


To Test
To test that the data is actually syncing between the hosts copy some files on the drbd01, the primary, to /srv: 
sudo cp -r /etc/default /srv
sudo umount /srv

Demote the primary server to the secondary role: 
sudo drbdadm secondary r0

Now on the secondary server promote it to the primary role: 
sudo drbdadm primary r0

sudo mount /dev/drbd0 /srv
