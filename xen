Xen is a type 1, bare-metal virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor), which provides the ability to run one or more operating system instances on the same physical machine. 

Install a 64-bit hypervisor. 
sudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-amd64

Modify GRUB to default to booting Xen: 
sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_DEFAULT=.*\+/GRUB_DEFAULT="Xen 4.1-amd64"/' /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub

Set the default toolstack to xm (aka xend): 
sudo sed -i 's/TOOLSTACK=.*\+/TOOLSTACK="xm"/' /etc/default/xen

sudo reboot
verify that the installation has succeeded
sudo xm list

Network Configuration
set up linux bridging in Xen. It assumes eth0 is both your primary interface to dom0 and the interface you want your VMs to use. It also assumes you're using DHCP. 

sudo apt-get install bridge-utils

if you are working with a desktop install, disable Network Manager. 
sudo update-rc.d network-manager disable
sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop

Edit /etc/network/interfaces, and make it look like this: 
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto xenbr0
iface xenbr0 inet dhcp
    bridge_ports eth0

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

Restart networking to enable xenbr0 bridge: 
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart


The brctl command is useful for providing addition bridge information. 

Creating vms

There are many options for installing guest images:

    xen-tools: A set of scripts for creating various PV guests

    virt-manager.org: A management system using libvirt
    Converting an existing installation

    Downloading pre-build guest images (e.g. http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Guest_VM_Images) 


Create and format disk image file

sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/xen/images
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/xen/images/ubuntu-guest.img bs=1M seek=3096 count=0
sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /var/lib/xen/images/ubuntu-guest.img


Xen and Libvirt

Make the following change to the xend configuration in /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp:

(xend-unix-server yes)

Restart xend:

sudo /etc/init.d/xend restart

sudo apt-get install virtinst

sudo virt-install --name ubuntu --ram 256 --disk <path to LV or disk image> --location  http://mirror.clarkson.edu/fedora/linux/releases/16/Fedora/x86_64/os/


Summary
http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Choice_of_Toolstacks
The power and flexibility of the management of Xen is an important feature. Users have a choice to use xl, XAPI, libvirt, or another toolstack to manage their Xen system(s).

    xl is very lightweight and is a great choice for develpers or users who are most comfortable with Unix like CLI tools. 

    XAPI is a powerful toolstack that provides domain life-cycle management, pool-awareness (multiple Xen systems added to a central logical pool), and many other advanced features available with Xen. 

    libvirt is a generalized virtualization layer for managing various virtualization technlogies with a common toolkit (or toolstack).
