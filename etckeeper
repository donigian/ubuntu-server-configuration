install etckeeper
etckeeper allows the contents of /etc be easily stored in Version Control System (VCS) repository. It hooks into apt to automatically commit changes to /etc when packages are installed or upgraded. 

sudo apt-get install etckeeper

sudo etckeeper commit "..Reason for configuration change.."

sudo bzr log filename
sudo bzr status /etc/

any subsequent packages installed will automatically trigger config files (/etc) to be checked in.
